Arduino Fire Extinguishing Robot
Overview
This project involves the development of an Arduino-based Automatic Fire Extinguishing Robot. The robot is designed to detect the presence of fire using sensors and autonomously navigate towards the fire source to extinguish it using a built-in fire extinguisher module.

Features
Fire Detection: The robot is equipped with flame sensors to detect the presence of fire.

Autonomous Navigation: Utilizes motor control to navigate towards the detected fire source autonomously.

Fire Extinguisher Module: The robot includes a mechanism to release a fire-extinguishing agent when a fire is detected.
