Autonomous Fire Extinguishing Robot
-----------------------------------

Overview
-----------------------------------
This repository contains the code and documentation for an Autonomous Fire Extinguishing Robot. The goal of this project is to design and implement a robot capable of detecting and extinguishing fires in an autonomous manner. The robot utilizes a combination of sensors, actuators, and intelligent algorithms to navigate through an environment, identify fire sources, and apply appropriate extinguishing methods.


Features
------------------------------------
Autonomous Navigation: The robot is equipped with sensors such as lidar and cameras to navigate through its environment while avoiding obstacles.

Fire Detection: Utilizing advanced computer vision techniques, the robot can detect fire sources accurately.

Extinguishing Mechanism: The robot is equipped with a fire extinguishing mechanism, which can deploy extinguishing agents to suppress and eliminate fires.

Real-time Monitoring: The robot provides real-time feedback on its status, including navigation path, fire detection, and extinguishing actions.
